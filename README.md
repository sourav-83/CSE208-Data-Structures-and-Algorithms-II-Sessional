# CSE208: Data Structures and Algorithms II Sessional

This repository contains lab tasks, problem solutions, and practice implementations from the CSE208 sessional course at BUET. The course is a continuation of CSE106 and focuses on advanced data structures and algorithms, implemented primarily in C++.

## Course Overview

**Course Code:** CSE208  
**Course Title:** Data Structures and Algorithms II Sessional  
**Language:** C++  
**Institution:** BUET

The course includes practical applications of:


- Trees (Red Black Tree, Fibonacci Heap, Binary Heap, etc.)
- Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, etc.)
- Max flow algorithms
- MST algorithms
- Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)
- Hashing techniques
- Recursion and backtracking

To compile and run C/C++ files:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
